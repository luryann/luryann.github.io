        <h3>about me</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>pronouns: he/him&nbsp;</li>
            <li>i'm 16</li>
            <li>junior at alhambra high school, california</li>
            <li>microelectronics enjoyer</li>
            <li>i swim (CIF finalist)</li>
            <li>i enjoy spedning time in nature</li>
            <li>run linux servers as a side hobby</li>
            <li>i have strong leadership skills; i routinely maintain large projects (created by me), or lead activites for school and whatnot.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>
            My interests lie in <b>maintaining something</b>, <b>networks</b>, <b>various types of electronics</b>, and <b>software development</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm particularly interested in self-hosting! The concept of maintaining servers and server hardware has always fascinated me. The idea of leaving a computer running hundreds of miles away and talking to it through a really, really long wire is really cool. Currently, my setup hosts a diverse array of services for friends and myself, such as WireShark instances, Minecraft servers, NextCloud instances, and various other miscellaneous things. And it's all done on a 2 core Celeron/4gb RAM Chromebox i got for 20 bucks. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Apart from my tech pursuits, I find joy in nature, outdoor activities, and watching sunsets. When I was younger, I used to think gaming all day was cool. As I grew older, I realized enjoying time outside is pretty cool as well. Looking ahead, I would also like to venture into the field of aviation; I've always been interested in aviation and I think it'd be awesome if I learnt how to fly someday.
